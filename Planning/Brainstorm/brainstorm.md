**SG60pop: Memory Match**

## What it is:

A vibrant, Singapore-themed memory game celebrating SG60 using pop-art icons like the Dragon Playground and Merlion.
It focuses on clean UI and smooth CSS animations.

## How it works:

**The Grid:**
Players face a 4x3 grid of face-down cards.

**The Logic:**
Flip two cards at a time. If they match, they stay up; if not, they flip back after a 1-second delay.

**Win/Loss:**
Match all 6 pairs before the 60-second timer hits zero to win ("Shiok!"). If time runs out first, you lose ("Alamak!").

### idea 2

**Spotify "Sound-Track" Charades**

## What it is:

A sleek, dark-mode quiz game where players guess famous song titles based on emoji strings (e.g., 👁️🐯 for Eye of the Tiger), styled to look like a "Spotify Wrapped" feature.

## How it works:

**The Quiz:**
The game displays an emoji string and 4 multiple-choice buttons.

**The Progression:**
Each correct answer fills a "Progress Bar."

**Win/Loss:**
Reach 100% on the progress bar (10 songs) to win the "Platinum Record." You lose if you exhaust your 3 Heart lives through wrong guesses.

### idea 3

**The "IKEA" Spaceman (Hangman)**

**The Concept:**
You are trying to name a new IKEA furniture piece before the assembly instructions disappear!
**How to Play:**
The game picks a famous (and hard to spell) IKEA product name like _BILLY_, _KALLAX_, or _POÄNG_.

### idea 4

**Omi: 1v1 Trump Duel**

## What it is:

A digital 1v1 adaptation of the traditional Sri Lankan card game. It’s a tactical trick-taking game played against a computer "dealer."

## How it works:

**The Tricks:**
Both players are dealt cards, and a "Trump" suit is chosen. Players must follow the suit led; the highest card wins the trick unless a Trump card is played.

**The Rounds:**
The winner of a trick leads the next card.

**Win/Loss:**
Secure 5 tricks to win a round. The first player to win 3 rounds wins the entire duel. You lose if the computer reaches 3 round wins first.
