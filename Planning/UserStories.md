3. As a user, I want to click or hover "How to Play" and see the instructions appear on the same screen without navigating away.

## Screen 2 — Game Board

7. As a user, I want to click a card to flip it and reveal either a song name or an artist name.

9. As a user, I don't want to be able to click a third card while two unmatched cards are still visible, so the game doesn't get into a broken state.
10. As a user, I don't want to be able to click an already matched card, so I'm not confused into thinking I'm still searching.
11. As a user, if I click the same card twice, I want nothing to happen so it doesn't count as a move.
